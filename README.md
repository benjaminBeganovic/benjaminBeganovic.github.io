Example of personal photo gallery web app with dropbox APIs.

This is simple web app that shows how to use dropbox APIs. The application shows how to:
  -Upload, download, delete file (here it is picture) from dropbox
  -Authenticate
  -Present data in html
  -Write Json in a file on disk
  
For testing purposes only! In real application we would have to implement file prefetching and a few more things :D
